     and therefore if you don't complete the activation (you can reset Session for example)
     then the server will keep its part of shared secret but nobody will be able to use that

     Discussion
     
     The method doesn't perform password validation and therefore if the wrong password is provided, 
     then the knowledge key will be permanently lost. You have to validate password on the server by 
     calling some sevice endpoint, which requires knowledge factor for correct operation.
     
     So, the typical flow for password change is:
     
         1. ask user for an old password
         2. send HTTP request, signed with knowledge factor, use an old password for key unlock
              - if operation fails, then you can repeat step 1 or exit the flow
         3. ask user for a new password as usual (e.g. ask for passwd for twice, compare both,
            check minimum length, etc...)
         4. call `changeUserPassword` with using old and new password
         5. save Session's state

     The adding new key for biometry factor is a quite complex task. At first, you need to ask server

     correctly raised and next subsequent operation for vault key decryption will finish correctly.

     If you don't receive response from the server then it's OK to leave the Session as is. Our local
     counter is probably at the same value as server's or slightly ahead and therefore everything
     should work correctly later. The Session only displays warning to debug console about previous
