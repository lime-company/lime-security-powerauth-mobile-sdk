     The additional encryption key is useful in  multibanking applications, where it allows the
     application to create chain of trusted PA2 activations. If the key is set, then the session will
     perform additional encryption / decryption operations when the signature keys are being used.

     once the session is activated with the EEK, then you have to use that EEK for all future cryptographic
     operations. The key is NOT serialized in the session's state and thus it's up to the application,
     how it manages the chain of multiple PA2 sessions.
