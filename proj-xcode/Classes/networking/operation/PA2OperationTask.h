/** Class representing a PowerAuth 2.0 client operation.
 
 Operations in PowerAuth 2.0 client consist of multiple steps. First, a request must be prepared - this may require asynchronous call on it's own (for example, access to Keychain would block main thread otherwise). Then, a network request must be created and executed on a separate data task. This task encapsulates all operations under single class.
