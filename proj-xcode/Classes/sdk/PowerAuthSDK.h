 WARNING
 
 This property is exposed only for the purpose of giving developers full low-level control over the cryptographic algorithm and
 managed activation state. For example, you can call a direct password change method without prior check of the password correctness
 in cooperation with the server API. Be extremely careful when calling any methods of this instance directly. There are very few
 protective mechanisms for keeping the session state actually consistent in the functional (not low level) sense. As a result, you
 may break your activation state (for example, by changing password from incorrect value to some other value).
