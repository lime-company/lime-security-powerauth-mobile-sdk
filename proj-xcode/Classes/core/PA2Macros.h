/**
 PALog(...) macro prints debug information into the debug console and is used internally
 in the PowerAuth SDK. By default, the macro is expanded to NSLog(...), but only for DEBUG 
 build configuration. You can control this behavior by defining following macros:
 
	ENABLE_PA2_LOG		- force enables debug logs
	DISABLE_PA2_LOG		- force disables debug logs
 
 If both, DISABLE_PA2_LOG and ENABLE_PA2_LOG are defined, then the compile error is produced.
