 Macro for marking interface as deprecated. You have to provide a version in which was this
 deprecation introduced. For example: PA2_DEPRECATED(0.19.0)
 
 We're keeping deprecated API's up to the next major release of SDK. For example, if something
 is marked as deprecated in 0.18.x, then the interface will be removed in 0.19.0
